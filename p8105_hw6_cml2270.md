## Setup

Only done once, the setup code loads the necessary libraries and double
checks that the working directory is correct. It also sets defaults for
figure size with knitr, as well as a default theme and color scale for
all ggplots.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1: Birthweight Data

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underlie birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in
making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

    One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)
    One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these

Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use crossv\_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”.

``` r
birthweight_df =
  read_csv("birthweight.csv") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    frace = as.factor(frace, levels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Uknown")),
    frace = fct_relevel(frace, levels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Uknown"))
  )


frace = factor(frace, levels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Uknown")),
    mrace = factor(mrace, levels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Uknown"))
```

#### EDA To Generate Hypotheses for a Model

Note that only three subjects had previously had live births, so for
most subjects the `parity` variable is = 0. Similarly, no subject has a
recorded previous low birthweight baby (`pnumlbw`), and no subjects have
a recorded previous small for gestational age baby (`pnumgsa`).

# Problem 2: Bootstrap Central Park Data

The boostrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a
parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down
distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We’ll focus on a
simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the
predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities
estimated from these data:

    r̂ 2

1.  

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your
estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap
estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95%
confidence interval for r̂ 2 and log(β̂ 0∗β̂ 1). Note: broom::glance() is
helpful for extracting r̂ 2 from a fitted regression, and broom::tidy()
(with some additional wrangling) should help in computing log(β̂ 0∗β̂ 1)

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

  select(bstrap_number, results) %>% 
  unnest(results)

confidence_interval_rsq = quantile(rsq_df$r.squared, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
```

The 95% confidence interval for log(β̂ 0∗β̂1) across 5000 bootstrap
samples is (1.965, 2.059).

The 95% confidence interval for r2 across 5000 bootstrap samples is
